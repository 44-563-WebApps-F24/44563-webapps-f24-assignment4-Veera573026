            <p><b> CREON. </b></p>
            <p> Good; for my message is that even our woes,<br>
            When brought to their right issue, shall be well.</p>
            
            <p><b> OEDIPUS. </b></p>
            <p>What saith the oracle? Thy words so far<br>
            Neither embolden nor dishearten me.
            </p>
            
            <p><b> CREON. </b></p>
            <p>Say, must I tell it with these standing by,<br>
            Or go within? I am ready either way</p>
            
            <p><b> OEDIPUS. </b></p>
            <p>Speak forth to all. The burden of their grief<br>
            Weighs more on me than my particular fear.
            </p>
            
            <p><b> CREON. </b></p>
            <p>My lips shall utter what the God hath said.<br>
            Sovereign Apollo clearly bids us drive<br>
            Forth from this region an accursed thing<br>
            (For such is fostered in the land and stains<br>
            Our sacred clime), nor cherish it past cure.</p>
            
            <p><b> OEDIPUS. </b></p>
            <p>What is the fault, and how to be redressed?</p>
            
            <p><b>CREON. </b></p>
            <p>By exile, or by purging blood with blood.<br>
            Since blood it is that shakes us with this storm.
            </p>

            <p><b>OEDIPUS.</b></p>
            <p> Whose murder doth Apollo thus reveal?</p>

            <p><b>CREON.</b></p>
            <p>My gracious lord, before thy prosperous reign<br>
            King Laius was the leader of our land.</p>

            <p><b>OEDIPUS.</b></p>
            <p>Though I ne’er saw him, I have heard, and know.</p>

            <p><b>CREON.</b></p>
            <p>Phoebus commands us now to punish home,<br>
            Whoe’er they are, the authors of his death.</p>

            <p><b>OEDIPUS.</b></p>
            <p>But they, where are they? Where shall now be read<br>
            The fading record of this ancient guilt?</p>

            <p><b>CREON.</b></p>
            <p>He saith, ’tis in this land. And what is sought<br>
            Is found, while things uncared for glide away.</p>
